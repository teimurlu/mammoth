# Mammoth - An Extendible (General) Continual Learning Framework for Pytorch

Mammoth is a framework for continual learning research. With **more than 50 methods and 20 datasets**, it includes the most complete list competitors and benchmarks for research purposes.

The core idea of Mammoth is that it is designed to be modular, easy to extend, and - most importantly - _easy to debug_.
Ideally, all the code necessary to run the experiments is included _in the repository_, without needing to check out other repositories or install additional packages.

With Mammoth, nothing is set in stone. You can easily add new models, datasets, training strategies, or functionalities.

**[Check out the official DOCUMENTATION](https://aimagelab.github.io/mammoth/) for more information on how to use Mammoth!**

## Setup

- Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. NOTE: Pytorch version >= 2.1.0 is required for scaled_dot_product_attention (see: https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt/issues/763). If you cannot support this requirement, uncomment the lines 136-139 under `scaled_dot_product_attention` in `backbone/vit.py`.
- Use `main.py` or `./utils/main.py` to run experiments.
- New models can be added to the `models/` folder.
- New datasets can be added to the `datasets/` folder.

## Update roadmap

All the code is under active development. Here are some of the features we are working on:

- **Configurations for datasets**: Currently, each dataset represents a *specific configuration* (e.g., number of tasks, data augmentations, backbone, etc.). This makes adding a new *setting* a bit cumbersome. We are working on a more flexible way to define configurations, while leaving the current system as a default for retro-compatibility.
- **New models**: We are working on adding new models to the repository.
- **New training modalities**: We will introduce new CL training regimes, such a *regression*, *segmentation*, *detection*, etc.
- **Openly accessible result dashboard**: We are working on a dashboard to visualize the results of all the models in both their respective settings (to prove their reproducibility) and in a general setting (to compare them). *This may take some time, since compute is not free.*

All the new additions will try to preserve the current structure of the repository, making it easy to add new functionalities with a simple merge.

- The `data/` folder should not be tracked by git and is created automatically if missing.

Mammoth currently includes **21** datasets, covering *toy classification problems* (different versions of MNIST), *standard domains* (CIFAR, Imagenet-R, TinyImagenet, MIT-67), *fine-grained classification domains* (Cars-196, CUB-200), *aerial domains* (EuroSAT-RGB, Resisc45), *medical domains* (CropDisease, ISIC, ChestX).

## On the reproducibility of Mammoth

We take great pride and care in the reproducibility of the models in Mammoth and we are commited to provide the community with the most accurate results possible. To this end, we provide a `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` file in the repository that contains the results of the models in Mammoth.

The performance of each model is evaluated on the same dataset used in the paper and we report in `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` our results compared to the results reported in the paper. We also provide the exact command used to train the model (most times, it follows `python main.py --model <model-name> --dataset <dataset-name> --model_config best`).

We encourage the community to report any issues with the reproducibility of the models in Mammoth. If you find any issues, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us directly.

**Disclaimer**: Since there are many models in Mammoth (and some of them predate PyTorch), the process of filling the `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` file is ongoing. We are working hard to fill the file with the results of all models in Mammoth. If you need the results of a specific model, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us directly.

> *Does this mean that the models that are not in the `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` file do not reproduce?*
    
  No! It means that we have not yet found the appropriate dataset and hyperparameters to fill the file with the results of that model. We are working hard to fill the file with the results of all models in Mammoth. If you need the results of a specific model, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us directly.
